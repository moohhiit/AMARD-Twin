# Railway Control Center - Intelligent Railway Management System

A production-grade intelligent railway control backend and real-time dashboard built with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **Neo4j** (graph database), **MongoDB** (document database), **Socket.IO** (real-time communication), and **React** (frontend dashboard). The system simulates real-time train movement across a railway network graph with two AI-powered decision agents: a **Dynamic Rerouting Agent** and a **Smart Platform Allocation Agent**.

### Data Flow

1. **Seed Phase**: Neo4j gets the network graph (7 nodes, 8 edges). MongoDB gets 5 trains and platform logs.
2. **Engine Phase**: The simulator runs a tick loop (100ms). Each tick:
   - Reads segment properties from in-memory cache (Neo4j at startup)
   - Computes new positions for all trains
   - Detects congestion by counting trains per segment
   - Triggers AI agents when thresholds are exceeded
   - Emits state updates via Socket.IO (10x/second per train)
3. **Agent Phase**: Async agents evaluate conditions:
   - **Rerouting Agent**: Queries Neo4j for alternative paths using congestion-weighted Dijkstra
   - **Platform Agent**: Scores available platforms using waiting time + congestion + compatibility
4. **Dashboard Phase**: React frontend receives WebSocket events and renders:
   - SVG network map with animated train markers
   - Live telemetry feed, agent decision log, alert panel

## Key Features

### Real-Time Engine
- Tick-based simulation running at 10Hz (100ms intervals)
- Configurable simulation speed (0.5x to 5x)
- Smooth train movement with CSS transition interpolation
- Speed calculation based on train capability, track limit, congestion, and safe following distance

### Track Capacity System
- Each track segment has a defined capacity (2-4 trains)
- Congestion severity levels: LOW (50%), MEDIUM (70%), HIGH (90%), CRITICAL (100%)
- Trains slow down on congested tracks (50% speed reduction)
- Trains stop on blocked tracks
- Visual warnings: amber dashed lines for congested, red dashed lines for blocked

### Dynamic Rerouting Agent
- **Trigger conditions**: delay > 5 min, track blocked, or congestion >= 90%
- **Algorithm**: Neo4j Cypher query with congestion-weighted edge costs (OPEN=1x, CONGESTED=2x, BLOCKED=100x)
- **Path scoring**: Considers travel time, number of segments, and congestion history
- **Cooldown**: 30 seconds between evaluations for the same train
- **Result**: New route saved, reroute event logged and emitted

### Smart Platform Allocation Agent
- **Trigger condition**: Train within 10km or 5 minutes of next station
- **Scoring formula**:
  - `waiting_time_score = min(minutes_free * 0.5, 10)`
  - `congestion_score = (1 - adjacent_congestion) * 10`
  - `length_score = min(length_margin / 50, 5)`
  - `proximity_score = max(0, (5 - platform_number) * 0.5)`
- **Wait state**: If no platform available, train enters WAIT status and retries every 10 seconds

### Real-Time Dashboard
- Dark-themed control center UI with blueprint grid background
- Interactive SVG network map with zoom, pan, and layer modes
- Animated track segments (dashed flow for congested/blocked)
- Pulsing station rings when trains are approaching
- Train detail cards on hover/select with speed, segment, delay info
- Three bottom panels: Live Telemetry, Agent Decisions, Active Alerts
- System status indicator with live clock

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step

1. **Seed the databases**:
   ```bash
   npm run seed:neo4j   # Creates 5 stations, 2 junctions, 8 track segments in Neo4j
   npm run seed:mongo   # Creates 5 trains, platform logs in MongoDB
   ```

2. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run server       # Starts Express + Socket.IO + initializes simulator
   ```

3. **Start the simulation** (auto-starts with server):
   - The simulator begins a tick loop running every 100ms
   - Each tick computes new positions, checks congestion, runs agents
   - All state changes are emitted via Socket.IO

4. **Open the dashboard**:
   - The React frontend connects via Socket.IO
   - Receives real-time train position updates (10x/second)
   - Renders the interactive SVG network map
   - Displays agent decisions and alerts as they happen

5. **Observe AI agents in action**:
   - When congestion builds on a shared track, the Rerouting Agent finds alternative paths
   - When a train approaches a station, the Platform Agent assigns the best platform
   - All decisions appear in the Agent Activity panel with timestamps

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+ and npm
- **Neo4j** 5.x (Community or Enterprise) running locally or accessible
- **MongoDB** 7.x running locally or accessible

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root (or use the provided one):

```env
PORT=3000
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/railway_control
SIMULATION_SPEED=1
ENGINE_TICK_MS=100
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### 3. Start Neo4j and MongoDB

Make sure both databases are running before seeding.

### 4. Seed the Databases

```bash
npm run seed
```

This runs both seed scripts in sequence:
- `seedNeo4j.ts`: Creates the railway network graph
- `seedMongo.ts`: Creates train and platform data

### 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend
npm run server

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend dev server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend API at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build          # Builds the React frontend to dist/
npm run server         # Serves frontend from dist/ + API
```

## Features Explained

### Real-Time Engine

The movement engine is the heart of the simulation. It runs on a 100ms tick loop and:

1. Computes the time delta (adjusted by simulation speed)
2. For each running train:
   - Gets the current track segment properties
   - Calculates speed: `min(train.max_speed, track.max_speed)`
   - Applies congestion penalty (50% reduction)
   - Applies blocked track penalty (0 speed)
   - Checks safe following distance (stops if within 2km of train ahead)
   - Updates position progress along the segment
   - Advances to next segment when progress reaches 100%
3. Detects congestion by counting trains per segment
4. Emits updates via Socket.IO

### Track Capacity System

Each track segment has a capacity limit (2-4 trains). The system monitors occupancy and assigns severity:

| Occupancy | Status | Visual |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| < 50% | Normal | Solid gray line |
| 50-70% | LOW | Solid gray line |
| 70-90% | MEDIUM | Amber warning |
| 90-100% | HIGH | Amber dashed animated line |
| >= 100% | CRITICAL | Red dashed animated line |

### Rerouting Agent

When trigger conditions are met, the agent:

1. Queries Neo4j for all simple paths from current position to destination
2. Excludes currently congested/blocked segments
3. Computes weighted travel time per path:
   - `weight = (distance / speed) * congestion_multiplier`
   - OPEN: 1.0x, CONGESTED: 2.0x, BLOCKED: 100.0x
4. Scores paths by travel time + segment count + congestion history
5. Only reroutes if savings > 2 minutes
6. Updates the train's route and emits a `train:rerouted` event

### Platform Agent

When a train approaches a station (within 10km or 5 min ETA):

1. Gets all platforms at the destination station
2. Filters for FREE platforms that can fit the train's length
3. Scores each platform:
   - **Waiting time** (40%): Platforms free longer score higher
   - **Congestion** (30%): Less congested adjacent areas score higher
   - **Length compatibility** (20%): Extra margin scores higher
   - **Proximity** (10%): Lower platform numbers (closer to exit) score higher
4. Assigns the highest-scoring platform
5. If none available, sets train to WAIT status and retries every 10 seconds

## Demo Explanation

### How Trains Move

After starting the system (`npm run seed && npm run server`), 5 trains begin moving from their origin stations:

- **Train 101** (Mumbai Express): MUM -> J1 -> BLR -> CHN -> HYD -> J2 -> DEL
- **Train 102** (Deccan Queen): Same route as 101, departs 1 minute later
- **Train 103** (Rajdhani): DEL -> HYD -> CHN
- **Train 104** (Shatabdi): DEL -> HYD -> CHN -> BLR
- **Train 105** (Karnataka Exp): BLR -> HYD -> J2 -> DEL

Trains 101 and 102 share the MUM-DEL route, creating natural congestion. Trains 103 and 104 share DEL-HYD and HYD-CHN. Train 105 shares HYD-J2-DEL with 101/102.

### How Rerouting Happens

1. Watch for trains 101 and 102 - they start on the same route
2. As they share segments, congestion builds
3. When a segment hits 90%+ capacity, the Rerouting Agent triggers
4. Check the **Agent Activity** panel - you'll see a magenta entry:
   > "Train 102 diverted to alternative path. Reason: Track CHN-HYD-A congested. Alternative saves 8 min."
5. On the map, the rerouted train's new path appears as a dashed magenta line
6. The train marker pulses with a magenta ring during rerouting

### How Platform Assignment Works

1. As any train approaches its next station (within 10km), the Platform Agent activates
2. Check the **Agent Activity** panel - you'll see a cyan entry:
   > "Platform Agent - Train 101 assigned Platform 2 at DEL. Score: 18.5"
3. The score breakdown shows: waiting time, congestion score, length compatibility
4. If all platforms are occupied, the train enters WAIT state (shown in telemetry)

### How to Trigger Events Manually

Block a track to force rerouting:
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/v1/tracks/CHN-HYD-A/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "BLOCKED"}'
```

Watch the dashboard:
- The track turns red with animated dashes
- A CRITICAL alert appears
- The Rerouting Agent finds a new path
- The train marker shows a magenta pulse

## Future Improvements

- **AI Prediction Models**: Use historical data to predict congestion before it happens
- **Weather Impact Integration**: Factor in weather conditions (rain, fog) that affect speed
- **Passenger Load Optimization**: Optimize platform assignment based on passenger density
- **Historical Analytics Dashboard**: Show trends, average delays, busiest segments over time
- **Multi-Server Scaling**: Support distributed simulation across multiple nodes
- **WebRTC Video Feeds**: Integrate live camera feeds from stations
- **Mobile App**: Companion mobile app for on-the-go monitoring
- **Machine Learning**: Train models on simulation data to improve agent decisions
